# CC Lab 2 – Monolithic Architecture

## Course
Cloud Computing

## Student Details
- **Name:** Nanduri Ashish Chander
- **SRN:** PES2UG23AM065
- **Section:** AIML-6B

## Aim
To study **Monolithic Architecture** by implementing a FastAPI-based monolithic application, observing system failure, fixing bugs, and performing load testing and performance optimization.

---

## Description
A monolithic application is an architectural style where all components such as user interface, business logic, and database access are tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit.

In this lab, a fest management system is implemented as a monolithic application using **FastAPI**. The experiment demonstrates how a single bug can crash the entire system and how performance can be improved through code optimization and load testing.
